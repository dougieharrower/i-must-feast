# 🦔 I MUST FEAST

**I MUST Feast** is a dark comedy horror game about a human-sized vampire hedgehog who lives in a park — and must. always. feast.  
You’ll sneak through sunlit playgrounds, lure unsuspecting victims, and stockpile bodies before winter — all while dodging Van Helsing types, garlic knot kiosks, and the rising sun.

## 🎮 Core Features

- 🌞 **Sunlight matters**: Health drains in light, regenerates in shadows, and feeding boosts it.
- 🕶️ **Stealth and strategy**: Victims are passive unless you make a scene. Plan your attacks carefully.
- 🎯 **Mission-based gameplay**: Retrieve amulets from sandboxes, lure kids with toys, sabotage the ice cream truck, and more.
- 🧛 **Goth meets goof**: Inspired by *What We Do in the Shadows*, *Bob’s Burgers*, and *Taskmaster*.
